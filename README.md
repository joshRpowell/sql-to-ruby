# SQL to Ruby

This is a small application that parses SQL queries and converts them into equivalent Ruby code using ActiveRecord. It is very much a work-in-progress.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `ruby app.rb` to start the server. Then you can view `http://localhost:4567` in your browser.
